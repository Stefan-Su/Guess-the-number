# Program: Guess the number

The computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 100.\
Afterward, give the user a hint to guess the number.

Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another hint and his score is reduced.\
The clue can be a multiple, divisible, larger or smaller, or a combination of all of the above.

You will also need functions to compare the entered number with the guessed number, to calculate\
the difference between the two, and to check whether or not an actual number was entered.

As soon as the user has guessed the correct number, a success text is displayed in the\
terminal, e.g. "You guessed right. The random number was 42!".
